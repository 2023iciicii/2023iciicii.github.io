    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
The Automotive and aerospace industry are facing challenges in terms of improving emissions and fuel economy, and at the same time reducing the overall cost.  Another similarity is the move towards replacing mechanical and pneumatic systems with electrical systems, thus transitioning toward “more electric” architectures and hybrid propulsion systems.  To meet these challenges in the automotive industry, significant work has been done in the areas of electric, hybrid, and fuel cell vehicles.  In the case of airplanes, more electric architecture , fuel cell, and hybrid propulsion strategies are the emerging trends.  Recently, there is also an increasing interest in flying cars, and Electrical vertical take-off and landing vehicles (eVTOL) to be used as air taxis. This presentation highlights the current research and development work going on the area of road and air transportation, and the future strategies for achieving net  zero emission. It also examines the synergies between the electrical systems for electric/hybrid vehicles, electric and hybrid aircrafts, and flying cars/VTOL vehicles. In addition, this presentation also discusses how the power electronics and electric motors technologies are enabling for the advancement of the electrified transportation.
