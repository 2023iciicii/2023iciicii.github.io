    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made tremendous progress in the past few years and has been widely applied across various fields. In the next five years, AI will continue to evolve, bringing more innovations and transformations. Particularly in the field of intelligent manufacturing, AI technology will play a crucial role in driving the upgrade of production methods and industrial models. Here are the latest developments and trends in AI over the next five years, along with its applications in intelligent manufacturing: 1) Integration of Big Data and AI: With the explosive growth of business and internet data, traditional data processing methods are becoming obsolete. In the future, AI will integrate with big data, extracting valuable information and providing decision-making support through data analysis and deep learning technologies; 2) Convergence of Edge Computing and IoT: Edge computing brings AI technology closer to the data source, enabling intelligent devices and the Internet of Things (IoT) to process and respond to data in real-time. This will lead to more efficient operations and more precise decision-making in intelligent manufacturing; 3)Machine Learning and Automation: Machine learning will become one of the core technologies of AI, enhancing autonomous learning and adaptability through data learning and pattern recognition. Concurrently, automation technology will further develop and be applied to make production processes more intelligent and efficient; 4) Human-Machine Collaboration: The advancement of AI technology will lead to closer cooperation between machines and humans, creating a synergistic effect. For example, in intelligent manufacturing, robots and workers can achieve more efficient cooperation and interaction, improving production efficiency and quality; and 5) Explainability and Trustworthiness: As AI is widely applied in various industries, the demands for the explainability and trustworthiness of AI systems are increasing. In the future, researchers will strive to improve the transparency and reliability of AI systems, making them more trusted in various fields.
