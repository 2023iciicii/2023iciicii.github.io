    <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>
    Assignment problems require more modelling investigations to meet the requirements of the real-world applications. Other than two conventional categories, i.e., generalized assignment and quadratic assignment, not many efforts have been put into further investigation theoretically. The reasons might be: 1) commercial optimization software platforms are developed and can solve most engineering problems if they are specified within the problem categories of the platform; 2) the generalized assignment modelling method is too abstract to express complex real-world problems.

        <p>
Role-Based Collaboration (RBC) and the E-CARGO (Environment â€“ Classes, Agents, Roles, Groups, and Objects) model have been proposed and verified as a promising approach to facilitating complex problem solving. It utilizes roles as underlying mechanisms to support collaboration. It is divided into several phases: role negotiation, role assignment, role execution, and role transfer. Role assignment can be categorized into three phases: agent evaluation, group role assignment, and role transfer. Agent evaluation rates the qualification of an agent for a role. It requires a check on the capabilities, experiences, and credits of agents based on role specifications. Qualifications are the basic requirements for possible role-related activities. It is a fundamental and challenging problem that requires advanced methodologies, such as information classification, data mining, pattern search, matching and multiple attribute decision making (MADM).

In GRA, there are many constraints we need to consider. These constraints may come from current states of roles, agents, and objects and future dynamic role execution situations, including conflicts, cooperation, limitations, preferences, and feasibility. Solutions to the GRA with constraints (GRA+) problems can be more easily applied to various applications. GRA+ also initiates a strong requirement for pertinent qualification (Q) matrices, which can be composed by MADM.

        <p>
This talk illustrates a new category of assignment problems by reviewing and extending the problems related to GRA from a novel vision. We discuss GRA+ problem instances and provide a generalized formalization of this category of problems, i.e., one highly abstract optimization problem, which is specified for the first time in the field. These problems will inspire much potential research on related topics including MADM.
