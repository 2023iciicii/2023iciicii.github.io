    <h3>Biography</h3>
    <p>
Art Bretas is a Senior Power Systems Research Engineer with the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). Prior to joining PNNL, Dr. Bretas has held several research and academic positions all over the world, including the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS). Dr. Bretas supports a variety of projects related to the development of Models and Algorithms for Energy Decarbonization through Grid Control and Energy Storage. Towards achieving these goals, Dr. Bretas current research lies on the general theme of Distributed Wide-Area Measurement Systems Applications in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Since 2002 Dr. Bretas has worked as a PI/Co-PI on many R&D projects with the Power Industry. These projects concern, for example, CPS Cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, Distributed Optimization and Control, Power System Stability and Real-Time Monitoring, Distribution Systems Reliability Optimization and Expansion Planning under Uncertain Operation Scenarios. Dr. Bretas has published many papers on peer-reviewed conferences and journals, as well as a textbook on Cyber-Physical Power Systems State Estimation.
